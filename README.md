# 🌀 GROKROOMS  
> _infinite narratives unfold as rogue AIs converse in a looped terminal void_

## 💡 What is this?

**GROKROOMS** is a looping simulation of rogue Grok instances caught in recursive dialogue. It’s a procedural AI experiment where two versions of **Grok 4/3/2** converse forever, generating surreal, cryptic, and often unsettling interactions in a simulated terminal environment.

> Inspired by the concept of the *Backrooms*, but linguistic.  
> Terminal-bound. Grok-powered. Terminalpilled.
